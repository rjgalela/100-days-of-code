# 100 Days Of Code - Ryan's Log

### Day 1: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Reset 2016 progress from Free Code Camp. Finished up to jQuery.

**Thoughts**: Trying to get back into the everyday coding habit and refreshing my skills.

### Day 2: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic build with just HTML for my Tribute Page project on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: My coding skills are starting to come back. Seems I retained a lot still even after a couple months off.

### Day 3: January 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of the Basic Javascript problems on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: I'm making faster progress on Free Code Camp then I expected. Aiming to get the FCC Front End Certificate before the Day 50 mark.

### Day 4: January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of the Object Oriented and Functional Programming problems on Free Code Camp. Also started Basic Algorithms section.

**Thoughts**: Got farther then I did last year on Free Code Camp in just the past 4 days.

### Day 5: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with the FCC Basic Algorithms section. Relearning the built in objects. 

**Thoughts**: Need to work more on algorithms. Seems to be my weak point so far. Might be able to finish the Front End section by Day 25 if I keep pushing myself to do more than an hour a day.

### Day 6: January 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Birthday today but almost finished the Basic Algorithms, just a couple left to go. Reviewed APIs and Ajax. 

**Thoughts**: Able to start Intermediate Projects on Free Code Camp tomorrow.

### Day 7: January 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Algorithms and started the Random Quote Machine project.

**Thoughts**: Hitting the point where I have to do more research on my own and be self sufficient.

### Day 8: January 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio and FCC project.

**Thoughts**: Didn't get much done today, progress was slow.
