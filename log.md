# 100 Days Of Code - Ryan's Log

### Day 1: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Reset 2016 progress from Free Code Camp. Finished up to jQuery.

**Thoughts**: Trying to get back into the everyday coding habit and refreshing my skills.

### Day 2: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic build with just HTML for my Tribute Page project on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: My coding skills are starting to come back. Seems I retained a lot still even after a couple months off.

### Day 3: January 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of the Basic Javascript problems on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: I'm making faster progress on Free Code Camp then I expected. Aiming to get the FCC Front End Certificate before the Day 50 mark.

### Day 4: January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of the Object Oriented and Functional Programming problems on Free Code Camp. Also started Basic Algorithms section.

**Thoughts**: Got farther then I did last year on Free Code Camp in just the past 4 days.

### Day 5: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with the FCC Basic Algorithms section. Relearning the built in objects. 

**Thoughts**: Need to work more on algorithms. Seems to be my weak point so far. Might be able to finish the Front End section by Day 25 if I keep pushing myself to do more than an hour a day.

### Day 6: January 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Birthday today but almost finished the Basic Algorithms, just a couple left to go. Reviewed APIs and Ajax. 

**Thoughts**: Able to start Intermediate Projects on Free Code Camp tomorrow.

### Day 7: January 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic Algorithms and started the Random Quote Machine project.

**Thoughts**: Hitting the point where I have to do more research on my own and be self sufficient.

### Day 8: January 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio and FCC project.

**Thoughts**: Didn't get much done today, progress was slow.

### Day 9: January 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Spend too long on one algorithm. Still tweaking Random Quote Machine project.

**Thoughts**: Need to time myself and not spend too much time on one thing. Also take breaks.

### Day 10: January 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spend too long on one algorithm again... but finished next one easily. Overthinking a lot.

**Thoughts**: I should probably invest in a whiteboard or try solving problems on paper if I'm stuck.

### Day 11: January 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Review day on Python stack. Pivoted from MEAN for a bit.

**Thoughts**: As I'm learning new things, I need to make sure to refresh on old material such as other programming languages and frameworks.

### Day 12: January 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Review day on Python stack with Flask. Rebuilding some projects.

**Thoughts**: Taking it one step at a time. 

### Day 13: January 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still tweaking Random Quote Machine project. 

**Thoughts**: Want to finish it by tomorrow and start a new project.

### Day 14: January 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Random Quote Machine project for now and started the next one, Local Weather.

**Thoughts**: Feel like I'm about to hit that wall again but going to keep pushing.

### Day 15: January 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Coded for just an hour today while looking at other APIs.

**Thoughts**: Slow day, hoping to speed up my progress this weekend.

### Day 16: January 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Local Weather project and did a couple algorithms.

**Thoughts**: Thinking of a personal project that might boost my productivity.
