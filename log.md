# 100 Days Of Code - Ryan's Log

### Day 1: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Reset 2016 progress from Free Code Camp. Finished up to jQuery.

**Thoughts**: Trying to get back into the everyday coding habit and refreshing my skills.

### Day 2: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic build with just HTML for my Tribute Page project on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: My coding skills are starting to come back. Seems I retained a lot still even after a couple months off.
